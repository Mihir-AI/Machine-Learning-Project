# Machine-Learning-Project
This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to:

Load and preprocess historical bulldozer sales data

Engineer meaningful features (date parsing, handling missing values, encoding)

Train regression models to predict bulldozer prices

Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics (e.g., RMSLE)

Generate predictions for unseen test data

The goal is to create a model that can accurately estimate bulldozer sale price based on its characteristics (year, model, condition, etc.).
